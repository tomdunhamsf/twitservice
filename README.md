twitservice
===========

I wanted to Unfollow fewer people than available with TweetAdder so I use this
	  to read in a list of twitter ids (generated by my own criteria based on ratio and lists)
	  Like TweetAdder I wait for user input to comply with
	  the automation rules.
	  To be a good citizen, I also recommend doing no more than around 15 at a time.
